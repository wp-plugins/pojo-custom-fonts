Pojo Custom Fonts allows you to add as many custom fonts as you need to your theme  which works with Pojo Framework. It then allows you to use them in the typography fields in the customizer area. No CSS knowledge required!

== Description ==

Please Note: This plugin is for [Pojo Framework][1] users only.

With Pojo Custom Fonts you can add an unlimited number of custom fonts to your Pojo theme, with full integration to your Customizer’s typography fields. All this with no CSS knowledge or coding required.

To upload a new font, select its name and add 4 of the font’s file types:

*   woff
*   ttf

*   eot

Then you can choose the new font from the font list in your theme’s Customizer.
